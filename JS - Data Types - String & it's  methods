 #  String are always stored in double or single quotes.
 #  If we store the number in double or single quotes, it consider as a string.
 #  You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes surrounding the string.
       EXAMPLE : "It's alright" ,  "He is called 'Johnny'" ,  'He is called "Johnny"'
    but the best way is, using the backslash :  "so-called "Vikings" from the north."
 #  To find the length of a string, we can use the built-in length property.
       EXAMPLE : let length = variablename.length 


STRING METHODS:-
1.Extracting String Parts:
There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:
slice(start, end)
substring(start, end)       # the index number (position number) of the string is start from 0.
substr(start, length)


2.Replacing String content:
replace()
replaceAll()
# The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string.
let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
# the above method replace the first word as Microsoft in para, if there is lost of words, we need to chage that, 
we can use replaceAll()

3.Converting to Upper and Lower Case:
A string is converted to upper case with toUpperCase()
A string is converted to lower case with toLowerCase()
  EXAMPLE : variablename.toUpperCase()

4. String concatination:
concat() joins two or more strings
  EXAMPLE : text = "Hello" + " " + "World!";
if we want to add a space between two we can use " ".
# also f we concat a number and string like 3 + "ramya", the result is 3ramya.

5.String trim() trimStart() trimEnd()
These three methods are used to remove the unwanted whitespace in the string.

6.JavaScript String split()
A string can be converted to an array with the split() method:
text.split(",")    // Split on commas
text.split(" ")    // Split on spaces
text.split("|")    // Split on pipe
EXAMPLES : 
1.let sentence = "This is a sample sentence.";
let wordsArray = sentence.split(" ");
// Output: ["This", "is", "a", "sample", "sentence."]

2.let csvData = "John,Doe,30,New York";
let dataArray = csvData.split(",");
// Output: ["John", "Doe", "30", "New York"]

3.let sentence = "This is a sample sentence.";
let wordsArray = sentence.split(" ", 3);
// Output: ["This", "is", "a"]

4.let data = "apple,orange,banana;grape";
let items = data.split(/[;,]/);
// Output: ["apple", "orange", "banana", "grape"]



** Automatic replacing of variables with real values is called string interpolation **
let firstName = "John";
let lastName = "Doe";
let text = `Welcome ${firstName}, ${lastName}!`
For this method we can back ticks instead of qoutes
