Why Study JavaScript?
JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:
   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
Example:-
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";
</script>
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, because script interpretation slows down the display.

Scripts can also be placed in external files:
JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
Example:-
<script src="myScript.js"></script>


JS - OUTPUT
JavaScript Display Possibilities
JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

  Using innerHTML
To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method.
The id attribute defines the HTML element. The innerHTML property defines the HTML content:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My First Paragraph</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
</script>
</body>
</html>

Using document.write()
For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write()
Never call document.write after the document has finished loading. It will overwrite the whole document.
EXAMPLE:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<button type="button" onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Try it</button>
</body>
</html>
output :  First Web Page
        My first paragraph
            BUTTON
after click the button, only 11 will distplay.
Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML.


Using window.alert()
You can use an alert box to display data:
Example:-
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<script>
window.alert(5 + 6);
</script>
</body>
</html>

You can skip the window keyword.
In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object.
This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object.
This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional:


  JavaScript Print
JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods
You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.
The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>
</body>
</html>
